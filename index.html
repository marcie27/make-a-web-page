      A web is a text document written in  a language called HTML(HyperText Markup Language). Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.Type of files on the web are: Plain text, HTML, images, videos, music

    <p>
      You were introduced to HTML tags (like <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>, and<span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span>) and saw how even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that is meaningful to web browsers.<span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>), and closing tag, 
      <span class="code">&lt;/p&gt;</span>)&lt;/p&gt;. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <span class="code">&lt;br&gt;</span>) tag). An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Attribute is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <span class="code"> www.udacity.com</span>)

      <b><em>How coding works.</em></b> Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands, writing with correct "syntax".
      </p>
      <p>
      <b><em>Programmers can't remember everything.</em></b> There are too many details to keep everything in your head.

      Computers are stupid

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
      Programmers often describe computers as "stupid". When they say this, they (usually) aren't insulting computers. They are addressing an important point about how computers understand the instructions that human programmers give them.Think about how sensitive computers are to typos and how small mistakes (mistakes that a "smart" human could easily correct) can lead to huge problems when given to a "stupid" computer.

      <p>
        HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.
        Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
        content inside of them.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
        elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
        draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
        multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
        nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
        boxes, and so on...

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
        of changing indentations going up and down the left side
        of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
        deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-descrition">
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
        Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
        life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
        generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

    <div class="concept-title">Avoiding Repetition
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Avoiding Errors:</em>When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Consistency:</em> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

  <div class="concept" id="lesson-3.2">
    <div class="concept-title">CSS
    </div>
    <div class="concet-description">
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
